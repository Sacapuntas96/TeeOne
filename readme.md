# TeeOne

**Count your carbs. Dose with confidence.**

TeeOne is a lightweight web app for people managing type 1 diabetes — search a food database, build a meal, track total carbs against a daily goal, and calculate the insulin units to inject, all in a fast, theme-aware interface.

## Features

- 🔍 **Food search** — instantly search a database of 600+ foods by name, with a live result count
- 🍽️ **Meal builder** — add foods to a cart, adjust the weight (in grams) per item, and see the carb total update live
- 📊 **Progress bar** — visual, color-coded progress (red → yellow → green) toward your daily carb goal
- 💉 **Insulin calculator** — computes units to inject from total carbs, your insulin-to-carb ratio, and any extra correction units
- ⚠️ **Guardrails** — warns when adding a food already in the cart, and when calculating with an invalid dosage
- ✨ **Animated totals** — smooth number-counting animation whenever the carb total or result changes
- 🌗 **Light / Dark theme** — theme preference is saved and persisted across visits via `localStorage`
